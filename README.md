auto mailer and reporting show page using Node.js and Mongodb

In order to run this project you must have node installed.  It is currently set up to run with a remote database hosted by Mlab, but that can easily be changed to a local Mongo database

To install node go here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

To install Mongo go here: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center
  
To avoid leaking sensitive keys, passwords, and other information, add a .env file in the root directory.

/.env
GMAIL_MAIL = email@gmail.com

GMAIL_PASS = emailpass1234

MLAB_PASS = mlabpass1234

MLAB_USER = userName

etc.

After adding the .env file, iniate the server (while in the project root directory) by running: 
- npm install
- node server.js

There are currently only 3 routes that work:
// (index.js)

1. post (/reports)
  This route takes in a json string object, parses it into json, saves it to the database and then sends an email

2. get (/reports/:report_id)
  This route brings up a show page for the user that has successfully posted a report, and recieved an email.The report id is generated and then added to the variable link in each email from the post(/reports)
  
3. post (/secret_posting_url_for_previewing_email)
  This route is just to help with checking post data, and email development.  Using the Postman application by Google makes it easier to decipher
